    <h2>Caramelized Pork Belly (Thit Kho)</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>TThis dish is very popular in Vietnamese households for everyday eating but is also traditionally served during Tet, the Vietnamese Lunar New Year.
             The longer you cook the pork belly, the more tender it becomes. 
             If you make this dish ahead, the fat will congeal on the surface, making it easier to remove, and a little healthier! 
             This also allows the flavors to meld a little more. 
             Serve with rice.</p>
