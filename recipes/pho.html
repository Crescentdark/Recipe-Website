    <h2>Authentic Pho</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Authentic, Vietnamese pho soup is all about the broth! Beef bones, 
            fish sauce, star anise, and ginger simmer for at least 6 hours, 
            creating a complex, aromatic broth that may not be quick, 
            but it's certainly delicious. 
            The flavorful broth is ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and topped with fresh garnishes.</p>
